      <h1 class="h2 center gold smphone left-aligned h3">Company: U4Uc - Unique Innovations for Unique Challenges</h1>
      <p class="text center white small left-aligned">The U4Uc mission is to bring together innovation partners, such as university design teams, and innovation advocates, such as powered wheelchair users, to solve unique challenges experienced by the advocates. U4Uc empowers advocates experiencing unique challenges that may have gone unresolved or unrecognized. U4Uc empowers partners to understand real challenges and team with those most aware of these challenges. Together they can learn understanding and altruism while learning that together they matter and are powerful.<br></p>

      <h1 class="h2 center gold smphone left-aligned h3">Application/Market Area Description</h1>
      <p class="text center white small left-aligned">There are approximately 2.7 million wheelchair users in the United States, many of whom use a powered wheelchair. The powered wheelchair market is also projected to grow significantly given the aging US population. The current US market size for wheelchairs is approximately 3 billion dollars. Cost effective safety enhancements are expected to form a significant segment of this market.<br></p>

      <h1 class="h2 center gold smphone left-aligned h3">Problem to be Solved</h1>
      <p class="text center white small left-aligned">Powered wheelchair users need to exercise extreme caution near certain obstacles: static obstacles (e.g., stairwells, ramp edges) and dynamic obstacles (e.g., pets). This increases tenfold when an environmental factor, such as icy ramps during winter, is added among other obstacles. The burden of safety is currently borne almost exclusively by the chair user as they navigate near these obstacles. Similarly, if a collision or an accident occurs, there are currently minimal safeguards to prevent the user from unintentionally engaging the joystick on the chair’s motor control system and worsening the accident. <br><br>One such incident happened with the innovation advocate associated with this project, Shane Burcaw. As Shane used a familiar ramp to exit a home, the wheelchair did not have enough friction to stay on course during peak winter months. Due to slippage, he was jerked forward, resulting in pushing the joystick forward to accelerate. The wheelchair tipped over, crushing Shane underneath. In addition, one of the straps that secured him to the chair failed. To rescue Shane from this accident, his dog assisted him by barking for help. The wheelchair was too heavy to be lifted alone by the first person to arrive. The problem to be solved in this project is to prevent accidents from occurring due to static and dynamic objects, as well as mitigate the severity of an accident through appropriate monitoring of the motor control system.<br></p>

      <h1 class="h2 center gold smphone left-aligned h3">Requirements for the Design</h1>
      <p class="text center white small left-aligned">The powered wheelchair safety system must provide detection system of common indoor or outdoor obstacles around the wheelchair, provide appropriate notification to the user, provide an interface to the chair user, and prevent the motor control system from responding to commands that could result in an accident or exacerbate an accident that has already occurred.  The prototype must be able to perform better than a human user and it must minimize any false-positive detection of obstacles or collisions. The design must be suitable for retrofit onto several chair models across multiple manufacturers. The design must also comply with any relevant regulations and standards (e.g. IEC 61508, WC19, and ISO 7176).<br></p>
