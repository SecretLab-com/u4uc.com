      <h1 class="h1 center gold smphone">What is the mission?</h1>
      <p class="text center white small">Our mission is to bring together innovators and people with unique challenges. U4Uc empowers people experiencing Unique Challenges that may have gone unresolved or unrecognized. U4Uc empowers Innovators to understand real challenges and team with those most aware of these challenges. Together they can learn understanding and altruism while learning that together they MATTER and are POWERFUL.<br></p>

      <h1 class="h1 center gold smphone">When will this happen?</h1>
      <p class="text center white small">We are doing a trial run right now to work out any usability issues. We hope to scale it up to a cohort of innovators and advocates by next year with our first university partner. Contact us if you want to be part of a future cohort.<br></p>

      <h1 class="h1 center gold smphone">Can I see students talk about their experience? Where can I see more examples of challenges being solved?</h1>
      <p class="text center white small">We are doing a trial run right now and hope to scale it up to a cohort of innovators and advocates by next year with our first university partner. Once we create the experiences, the videos will be posted on our website.<br></p>

    <div class="w-container">
      <h1 class="h1 center gold smphone">What is the scope of the differences and challenges?</h1>
      <p class="text center white small">Any challenge selected is experienced by a person or group of people, distinct from the majority (e.g., by ability, location, race, access, other) traditionally marginalized or denied support and resources. A challenge innovation must potentially benefit a person or population in a meaningful way providing inclusion into mainstream activities that were otherwise denied due to something beyond one’s control. In addition, any innovation must be realistically deliverable within the time limits of a given cohort.<br></p>

    <div class="w-container">
      <h1 class="h1 center gold smphone">The video tells the Why but what is the Who and the How? Who is the audience? Do they work directly with the university?</h1>
      <p class="text center white small">Bright Foundation is partnering with university staff to create this innovation experience. In addition, business will support the mission with resources. Students, referred to as the Innovation Partner, at the university will join this effort as part of their course work. They offer technical or adaptive ideas and exploration of design but have limited understanding of the challenge. A person or group, referred to as the Innovation Advocate, joins the team having direct experience with the challenge and eventually ensures that the solution fits the challenge. The Innovation Partner and the Innovation Advocate collaborate equally with each other. Eventually this will be done at the middle and high school level.  <br><br></p>

      <h1 class="h1 center gold smphone">Is this done independently or as a class, club, or department?</h1>
